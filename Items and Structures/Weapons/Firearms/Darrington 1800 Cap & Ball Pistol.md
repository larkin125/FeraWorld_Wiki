The **Darrington 1800 Model Revolvers** along with subsequent models and variations were [percussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percussion_cap) [revolvers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver) manufactured by [[Fitzgerald Darrington]] in .31 (Pocket) .36 (Navy) or .44 (Army) caliber, used during the [[Ilmarian Civil War]], and was the beginning of a successful line of medium and large frame pistols. They are commonly, though inaccurately, referred to as the **Model 1800** due to the patent markings on its New Model barrels, "PATENTED MID. 22, **1800**/F.DARRINGTON, ILMARIA/NEW MODEL."; although wide scale production did not start until 1805

The **Darrington 1800** revolver was a secondary, supplemental issue firearm for the Ilmarian Imperium. It saw use in the New World both in its original percussion configuration and as a metallic cartridge conversion, as well as around the world.
