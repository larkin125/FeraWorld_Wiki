The Darrington 1814 Breach Loading Rifle is a breech-loading single-shot lever-actuated rifle that was used by the Ilmarian Army. It first entered service in 1814, eventually replacing the Darrington 1730, a muzzle-loader converted to the cartridge system. Darrington 1814 variants were used throughout the Ilmarian Imperiumfor 47 years. It combined the dropping-block action first developed by Fitzgerald Darrington.

There were four main marks of the Darrington 1814 rifle produced: Mark I (released in Midyear 1814), Mark II, Mark III, and Mark IV. There was also an 1815 carbine version with variations that included a Garrison Artillery Carbine, an Artillery Carbine (Mark I, Mark II, and Mark III), and smaller versions designed as training rifles for military cadets. The Mark IV Darrington 1814 rifle ended production in 1830, but remained in service throughout the Ilmarian Imperium until the end of the Ilmarian Civil War.
