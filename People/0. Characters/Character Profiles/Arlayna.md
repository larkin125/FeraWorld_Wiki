# History
Caught on the road by Goblins, her caravan was attacked. The girl was caught and raped, the rest of her family and friends murdered and raped and eaten. As help came to save her, her throat was slashed by the goblin raping her.

Managing to slow the bleeding, she was taken to a nearby healer, a witch. The Witch healed her but told them 'a price would be paid'
