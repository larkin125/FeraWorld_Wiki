Summary
	Arizali translates as "Defective" into the old [[Üstün]] language. A name given to the young [[Yaralti]] girl due to the defect she carried since birth. 
	Arizali was deaf, a thing that would have had her strangled at birth with her very own cord if not for the position her mother held and that she was the first female of the [[Dhunnyr]] family to be born. 
	And so she got to live.

[[Night Mother  ]]

When [[Kräl Şah]] [[Yilmazok Akar]] took to his unification of the Empire, many fled, many fell. One of the most successful but long forgotten by all but her children was the [[Night Mother]]. Goddess of the [[Yaralti]], the Underground descendants of the [[Üstün]], evolving into the Dark Skinned, white haired Underground dwellers. The [[Night Mother]] was powerful enough to hide her people and gave birth to two daughters. [[Yikim]] and [[Aydinlamat]].
