Summary
Born in the village of [[Nyborg]] on the southern [[Ablos]] island of [[Alapori]], Astrid was the only child to [[Juuso]] and [[Elina]] [[Lytingdottir]]. Both her parents died when she was young to a plague that ran through [[Alapori]], leaving her living alone in her [[Nyborg]]. 
Her dream was to become a [[Shield-Maiden]], a warrior woman of the [[Ablos]] people, unfortunatly several villages of [[Alapori]] banned women from becoming warriors; keeping them to working at home while the men raided. 
She was going to become the first [[Shield-Maiden]] of [[Nyborg]]'s long history. 
And so when [[Jarl]] [[Viljo]] decided to raid the [[Fae]] [[Monastary of Feslios]], she snuck herself aboard the [[Long-Ship]] and headed to battle. 
Appearance
With the vivid blonde hair of her mother, Astrid's cheeks sun kissed cheek were lined with faint freckles and her teeth had a slight parting at the centre pair. Standing at 5ft 4", the girl stood with broad shoulders of her father and although in her younger years a flatter chest; this allowed her to sneak aboard the [[Long-Ship ]]on her first raid. 
Personality
Spunky and never letting things get to her, Astrid would much rather fight her way out of a situation before letting it get to her. Most of the time the girl did not think things through first but learnt that lesson on her first raid.
