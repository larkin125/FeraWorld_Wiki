At the age of 17, or just short of her 17th birthday, Isabella travelled with her father and mother in their stage coach, unaware that her father was using their journey as a cover for transporting illegal goods for a local gang. 
During this journey, the stage coach was robbed by the Van Der Graphe Gang led by Gideon Van Der Graphe. This was where she was robbed by a 17 year old Solomon Sinclair. After the robbery was interrupted by a local gang interceeding, Isabella was taken hostage by Solomon and the boy took the girl some distance away. After being shot twice, Solomon fell from his saddle. 
Isabella gave quick medical aide to the wounded bandit. Deciding not to leave the boy to die, Isabella took Solomon to a nearby castle owned by her bethrothed Phillip Heart.

Under her time with Solomon, she went by the name Jade Afton.
