Spell casting
You can cast known bard spells using CHA as your spellcasting modifier (Spell DC 12, Spell Attack +4) and known bard spells as rituals if they have the ritual tag. You can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus. 
Bardic Inspiration
As a bonus action, a creature (other than you) within 60 ft. that can hear you gains an inspiration die (1d6). For 10 minutes, the creature can add it to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. This can be added after seeing the roll, but before knowing the outcome. 
Uses: 2/Long Rest 
Jack of All Trades
You can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down ( +1 ), to any ability check you make that doesn�t already include it. 
Song of Rest
If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

Performance 
Cutting Words
As a reaction when a creature (that's not immune to being charmed) you can see within 60 ft. makes an attack roll, ability check, or damage roll, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration, roll the die, and subtract the number from the creature's roll. You can do so after the roll but before knowing the result. 
Sneak Attack
Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack with a finesse or ranged weapon if you have advantage on the attack roll. You don�t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 ft. of it, that enemy isn�t incapacitated, and you don�t have disadvantage on the attack roll. 
Thieves� Cant
You have learned thieves� cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly. 
Darkvision
You can see in darkness (shades of gray) up to 60 ft. 
Menacing
You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill. 
Relentless Endurance
When you are reduced to 0 HP but not killed, you can drop to 1 HP instead once per long rest. 
1/Long Rest 
Savage Attacks
When you score a critical hit, roll one of the dice an additional time and add it to the extra damage.
