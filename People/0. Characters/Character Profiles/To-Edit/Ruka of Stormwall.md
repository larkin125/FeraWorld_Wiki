Shikarii Training
The Shikari castle of Gundor was as ancient as The Order of the Wolf, maybe even longer. Its current caretaker, Daler, trained many young Shikari through the years.

The Beginning


Prime Years


The Shade


Retirement
After the long war with The Shade, Ruka and Ara had decided to settle down and finally retire from active service in the problems of the world. However this was a lot easier said than done for Ruka, the weary old Shikari could not keep himself down in one place and so on Swordsday the 34th of Dusk 1809 he set off on a little jaunt for a few weeks.
