History
Born to a farmer in the village of VILLAGE in the Principality of Alhuizenm Silas Hulins led a quiet life until he was constcripted into the Alhuizen army in the outbreak of the WAR_NAME between the Principalities of Alhuizen and Vesenhaus. 
It was on the border and outskirts of the Tillcaster River or more precisely the Atilisle river that flowed into the Tillcaster along with the Reidmeny and the Onoway. The Beauvon wood sat on its Eastern side and the battle had spilled into the woods. Silas had marched a long way to get there and into his first battle he had stood with the rest of his squad. 
There he had been killed by the Knight of Dal-Harad, or would have been if he had not been found by the Dryad Thylaise nin s'o cima, Murah ve s'o uh'el tan, a dryad girl on her Pilgrimage.
