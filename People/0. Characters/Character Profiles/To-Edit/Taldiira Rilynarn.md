History
[[Nave Nalore]] was one of the most powerful city states of the [[Yaralti]] to ever exist, its city limits stretched for miles under the surface of [[Fera]] and those above did had no idea of those that that lived below. Even the [[Dwarves]] knew little of the mysterious denizens of the Unter-land. They delved deep but not deep enough to reach the lands of the [[Yaralti]]. 
It was said they had been there since time immemorial, but some said they were not as ancient as that. Some said they fought the ancient evils before the �st�n and some said they were �st�n now turned anew. All of it stories and rumours. Very few on the surface knew of the Yaralti and those that did knew of only those who had fled from their under-home. 
In the grand city of [[Nave Nalore]], Taldiira was the only child of the Rilynarn bloodline, her father and mother one of the most powerful members of an Inter-City State Trading Company. They had power, they had wealth but it was not enough for the young girl. She had just turned the age of womanhood and would be expected to bear children, to join the women of the Unter-Land to forever keep the lineage alive. 
She did not want to. 
The fun was not stopping just for her to spread her legs and shit out a child or three. 
The first thing she had stole was a bun from a street vendor, it had been such a thrill and ever since the young age she had first stolen she and into her early teenage years she kept up the fun. Even when only a young girl and still was not yet of child bearing age but allowed some freedom, she crept into the city and became a thief of the night. 
Her long years of work paid off and now she was known to the clans and guilds of the city but not as her real name [[Taldiira Rilynarn]]; that would be a problem for her �real� life, but as "Jo�parmak". 
"[[Black Finger]]" 
With her long silvery white hair tied up in a high pony tail, the grey skinned girl sat in the back of a tavern on the docks of the [[Unterzee]], the vast ocean under the ground. 
She had a new job, a new customer.
