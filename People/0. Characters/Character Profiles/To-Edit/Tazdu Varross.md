Appearance
	Dressed in either leather or plate armour, Tazdu Varross; better known as The Stranger by most people and few by Quill is a perfect example of a member of '[[The Abandoned]]'. 
The key characteristic of a member of [[The Abandoned]] is their helmet.  Most, if not all, wear a sealed helmet that completely hides their face from view, this helmet is kept on at all times and only removed for food, sleep or in a time and place where the wearer will be alone. 

If the face is seen by anyone, it is a dishonour on the member and it cannot be replaced on the head. 

Most helmets come as Armets or full face helms. 
Quill is equipped with a longsword, a longbow, a [[Darrington 1814 Breach Loading Rifle]] and a set of [[Darrington 1800 Cap and Ball Pistols]]. 

Personality
	Quill has a stern temper and will. He is bound to his own code of honour and that of [[The Abandoned]]. He is loyal and knows when he must break the law to achieve what he needs.
