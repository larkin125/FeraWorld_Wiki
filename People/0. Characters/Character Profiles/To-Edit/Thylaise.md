Alheit Aichhalden was the name of the girl whom were taken by the Dryads of the Beauvon Wood. Stolen while playing in the fields, she got too close to the Wood and was snatched up. Transformed into a Dryad at the young age of six, she grew up within the Wood 
That was until she met Silas Hulins. Injured in a battle, Silas was found by the young Thyliase while on her Pilgrimage, a six year venture of solitude in the Wood as she became an adult. 
Taking care of the human boy, Thyliase had plans to kill him, as humans in the wood was forbidden yet she was too young to be allowed to kill so deciding to take care of the human until she finished her Pilgrimage and would be allowed by her culture to kill him.
