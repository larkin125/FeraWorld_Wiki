The days of the Imperial Line had renewed itself after the death of so many Royal Family members in the years leading up to 1700's of the Ilmarian Calendar. King [[Andreas Vandersryke]], known in his early years as 'The Usurper' and later 'The Just' held reign till his death in 1884 at the age of 92. He left behind a daughter and son, the son inheriting the reign of King after a series of incidents following the uprising of [The Hand of Orasil](The%20Hand%20of%20Orasil.md)l and the murder of King [[Andreas Vandersryke]] the Fifth.
Magic continued, the [[Entitled]] of the world kept their place as sole users of the arcane arts but technology kept its pace with the never changing yet powerful sorcery of the Entitled. A new type of magic had started in the early years of the 1600's with the rise of Gunpowder weaponry; [[Gunslinger]]s.
[[Gunslinger]]'s had been outlawed for years until [[Andreas Vandersryke]] had became King, a [[Gunslinger]] himself, he made a [[Cabal of Gunslingers]] to be his [[Royal Guard]], shunning the Entitled role to a second line. [[Gunslinger]]'s could shift the Musket balls mid-air, burning gunpowder kept in charges to do special skills; blowing up powder charges, firing two balls out of one gun and hitting a target ten times the range away.
[[Alrussia]], [[Ilmaria (City)]]'s continual nemesis in the Three Kingdoms had invaded the Imperial Fatherland twice before. Once in the early 1700's and the 2nd in the late 1700's to the early 1800's. Both times were called the "War of Alrussian Aggression.".
They invaded yet again in the early 1900's.
[[The Third War of Alrussia Aggression]] had began in the summer of 1902 and had been a sudden rush. [[The Front]], a large area of trenches and defences, had been manned but were quickly hit during a moment of weakness but the Imperials quickly fought back. They manned the defences and pushed back the line.
Yet again, [[The Front]] was manned for a long war.
It was Ten years since the first attack.
Viktoria Vogelweide was the daughter to a minor merchant, third family member and her older brothers had been drafted four years prior. She had applied for a job at the [[National Imperial Registery Office]] or "NIRO" but they had put her application through to the Home Office, there it was sent to recruitment.
How could a 19 year old typist be a soldier?
On [[The Front]], in [[Sector Alpha-11292771-0H]], it was raining. Mud squished through the plank floor boards and water poured over the parapet. Men and women were huddled up in the fire steps to try and keep out of the rain.
