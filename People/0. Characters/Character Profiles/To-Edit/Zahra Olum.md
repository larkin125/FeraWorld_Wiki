Appearance
With silvery white hair, Zahra is a purple to black skinned [[Yaralti]]. Her long silvery white hair is braided with a series of different metallic rings until it reaches her lower spine and rear. 
Zahra's deep vibrant yellow eyes peer out of her frowning brow, although she looks like she is somewhat unhappy the girl always has a smile on her lips. 
Personality
Known as a friendly hero by her own kind, this is all an act. Zahra is actually a servant of [[Cynsyet]], the Ancient God of Sexuality and her friendly manner is all a façade.
