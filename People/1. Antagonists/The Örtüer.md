# Appearance

[[The Rings of The Örtüer]] are various bands of various metals with various gems and stones inlaid into the metal. 

One may look like a simple golden band with no adornment while another might hold the clearest of diamonds in its clasp.

The figure whom wears the ring will take no appearance changes, at first. 

After some time, the figure's skin would become pallid and grey, turning white until it faded entirely. The mind and soul of the creature gone and bound to the ring. They would appear in void black robes, chain mail and plate armour under the vast layers of smoke like robes. 


# Personality

[[The Örtüer]] are unyielding, untiring. Their former souls and minds all but gone in the latter stages of the transformation. 


# History

[[The Örtüer]] are the weapons of their master, once mortal figures given rings of power by the vile  [[Kräl Şah]] [[Yilmazok Akar]] . These ten rings gave great power to their wielder but twisted their minds and bodies; drove them to give themselves to their master. 

In the later years, after [[Kräl Şah]] [[Yilmazok Akar]] 's reign of terror was defeated by [[The Nine Divines]] , some of the rings went into the hands of the Human's whom fought to defeat him. Warlords and powerful mortals took possession of the Rings and were soon driven again to destruction. 

Throughout the years the rings passed from legend to legend, soon captured and hidden by a band of adventurers .
