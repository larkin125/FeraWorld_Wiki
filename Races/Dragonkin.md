Dragonkin are humanoid descendants of Dragons, their origin is not understood clearly but their strengths are. Wide wings and long tails, these creatures are able to breath various elements as with their ancestors. 
Various societies of Dragonkin exist, either roving communities like those in the [[Ilmarian Imperium]] or settlers of grand Empires like the rest of the races around them. The [[Kalewen Dynasty]] is one key Dragonkin Empire settled in the [[Pawhye]] - [[The New World]], their Capital city of "[[The City Of Glass]]" a marvel to behold; entirely constructed in Glass forged from the Sands around them by their own breath.
