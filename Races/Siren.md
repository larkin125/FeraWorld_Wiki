The Siren race was one of the oldest races on Fera, their existence predates the [[Üstün]], in fact their Empire once ruled over the [[Üstün]], until the [[Üstün]] managed to rise up and take hold of the [[Ethereal]] powers of the Universe. 
The name 'Siren' is not their real name, their true name lost to the annals of history. Once a mighty Empire, now merely slaves to the [[Üstün]] Empire and looked down upon by most other races. 
Sprouting horns and tails, the Siren are multicoloured in appearance, ranging from a light blue to a deep red.
