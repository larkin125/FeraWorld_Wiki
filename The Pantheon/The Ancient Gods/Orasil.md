Orasil 
	God of Death 

One of the first Gods of Old, Orasil ruled with a mighty fist. His wraith became the very reason for mortality. This became the rule of the God of Undeath & Mutation 
During [[The Calamity]], it is said that records and religious texts say he was sealed away by Bodar and [[Vokmir]] with help of [[Humteus]].  

Several cults still exist praying to Orasil, some of them unknowingly praying to him or some in knowledge. One such cult is the "[[Hand of Orasil]]", part of the larger "[[Cult of Orasil]]", alongside "[[The Head]]", "[[The Mind]]",  "[[The Soul"]], "[[The Finger]]", "[[The Heart]]", and "[[The Eye]]".
