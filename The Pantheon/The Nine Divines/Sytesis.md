Sytesis, the first of the Goddesses and the Goddess of Beauty and fortune. Strangely, Sytesis was an [[Üstün]], a powerful [[Sorceress]] infact! 

The foul magic of the [[Kräl Şah]] [[Yilmazok Akar ]]had corrupted her people, Sytesis saw her people's strife and spent centuries working to keep the soul of her people alive. When the call came, she joined the Slaves to defeat the last of the [[Domain Lords]] and usher in her people's extinction.
