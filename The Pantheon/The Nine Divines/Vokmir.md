Once a grand [[Silver Dragon]], Vokmir, the God of Law & Dragons and the Last of the [[Silver Dragon]]'s, Vokmir's legacy still lives into the modern day with his priests praising the deacency of the [[Silver Dragon]].  

With no need to heed the call of battle, Vokmir flew to the help of the [[Human]]'s after a single human girl approached the grand dragon and begged for it to kill her, to put her out of her mysery.  

Instead, Vokmir took to the skies and became the Father of the [[Dragonkin]] race.
