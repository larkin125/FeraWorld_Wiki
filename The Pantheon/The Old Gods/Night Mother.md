Night Mother  
When [[Kräl Şah]] [[Yilmazok Akar]] took to his unification of the Empire, many fled, many fell. One of the most successful but long forgotten by all but her children was the Night Mother. Goddess of the [[Yaralti]], the Underground descendants of the [[Üstün]], evolving into the Dark Skinned, white haired Underground dwellers. The Night Mother was powerful enough to hide her people and gave birth to two daughters. [[Yikim]] and [[Aydinlamat]].
